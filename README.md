# 🏡 California Housing EDA

This project explores the **California Housing dataset** using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover the key features that influence **median house values**.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To identify trends, correlations, and patterns in housing data that affect pricing. This is a foundational step before building any predictive model.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [California Housing Dataset (GitHub)](https://github.com/akmand/datasets/blob/main/california_housing.csv)
- **Attributes**:
  - Location (longitude, latitude)
  - Housing median age
  - Total rooms & bedrooms
  - Population, households
  - Median income
  - Median house value
  - Ocean proximity

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Median Income** shows a strong positive correlation with housing prices.
- **Housing Age** and **Population** have weaker effects on price.
- Some high-price outliers may need to be treated during modeling.

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Outlier removal
- Feature engineering
- Regression modeling (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
